What is the legitimate extent of market inequality in the eyes of the public? Since the early 1980s, many countries have experienced a widespread retreat from universal welfare programs and a shift toward the privatization and commodification of public goods, welfare policies, and social services [@gingrich_making_2011; @streeck_how_2016]. In Latin America, as elsewhere, neoliberal reforms reshaped welfare-state institutions by extending market logic into domains of social reproduction that were traditionally governed by the state [@ferre_welfare_2023]. This transformation reduced the role of public provision and increased the presence of private actors in core social services [@ferre_welfare_2023]. Echoing Polanyi's [-@polanyi_great_1975] insight that markets constitute a distinct moral order, the institutional diffusion of market rules has fostered a corresponding moral economy: a constellation of norms and values concerning fair allocation, embedded in institutions and shaping individual subjectivities [@mau_inequality_2015; @svallforsMoralEconomyClass2006a]. Within this framework, a growing body of research examines the extent to which, and the mechanisms by which, citizens consider it fair that the allocation of services like health care, pensions, and education be governed by market-based criteria---a phenomenon known as *market justice preferences* [@busemeyer_skills_2014; @immergut_it_2020; @castillo_socialization_2024; @castillo_perceptions_2025; @koos_moral_2019; @lindh_bringing_2023; @lindh_public_2015]. Understanding these preferences is crucial, as they contribute to legitimizing economic inequality by framing it as the fair result of individual responsibility and limited state intervention [@mau_inequality_2015].

Existing literature shows that market justice preferences are shaped by both the economic and institutional context and individuals' positions within social stratification. Grounded in the notion that economic institutions influence people's normative attitudes [@immergut_theoretical_1998], studies find that countries with stronger public provision or more expansive welfare states exhibit lower levels of market justice preferences [@busemeyer_skills_2014; @immergut_it_2020], while more privatized contexts show stronger support for market-based criteria [@castillo_socialization_2024; @lindh_public_2015]. In such contexts, market justice preferences tend to rise as individuals "ascend" the social structure, with those in more privileged positions in terms of class, education, and income holding stronger preferences for market-based solutions compared to those in more disadvantaged or at-risk positions [@lee_fairness_2023; @vondemknesebeck_are_2016; @immergut_it_2020; @castillo_socialization_2024; @otero_power_2024; @lindh_public_2015; @svallfors_political_2007].

Market justice preferences are shaped not only by objective socioeconomic conditions but also by popular beliefs about inequality. Among these, meritocracy is a key normative principle underpinning market-based distributive preferences [@mau_inequality_2015]. Studies show that individuals with stronger meritocratic beliefs tend to perceive less inequality and legitimize it by attributing economic differences to personal achievement [@mijs_paradox_2019; @wilson_role_2003; @batruch_belief_2023]. In highly unequal societies where access to services is largely governed by market logic, such beliefs play a critical role in normalizing inequality. Recent evidence from Chile shows that students who believe effort and talent are rewarded in their country express stronger preferences for market-based access to healthcare, pensions, and education [@castillo_socialization_2024].

Although it is clear that one's social position influences market justice preferences, the question of how upward or downward mobility within the social structure affects these preferences remains unanswered. This question is far from trivial, especially in Latin America, where many have experienced various forms of mobility amid high economic inequality and deep welfare privatization [@lopez-roldan_comparative_2021; @torche_intergenerational_2014; @ferre_welfare_2023]. Social origins and destinations affect attitudes toward inequality in distinct ways [ @jaime-castillo_social_2019; @gugushvili_intergenerational_2016; @day_movin_2017; @gugushvili_subjective_2017; @wen_does_2021; @mijs_belief_2022], while movement between these positions exposes individuals to different experiences and mechanisms that shape their views on what is fair [@gugushvili_trends_2014; @mau_inequality_2015]. Building on this research, examining the effects of social mobility on market justice preferences can help to illuminate how inequalities in access to social services are justified among individuals who have experienced, or not, changes in their social standing, and what are the normative mechanisms that guide this justification [@mau_inequality_2015].

Beyond their isolated effects, social mobility and meritocratic beliefs interact in complex ways to shape market justice preferences. Among others, a key mechanism proposed in the literature to explain how mobility influences distributive justice preferences is the psychological process of self-serving bias in causal attribution [@schmidt_experience_2011; @gugushvili_intergenerational_2016c]. This bias suggests that individuals attribute failures---such as downward mobility---to external factors, while crediting successes---such as upward mobility---to their own merit and effort [@miller_selfserving_1975]. Those who experience upward mobility tend to view their social position as earned, making them more likely to believe that individuals are responsible for their own success or failure. Research shows that upward mobility is associated with weaker preferences for redistribution [@schmidt_experience_2011; @gugushvili_intergenerational_2016c; @jaime-castillo_social_2019; @alesina_intergenerational_2018] and stronger legitimacy of income inequality [@shariff_income_2016]. In contrast, individuals who experience downward mobility tend to blame structural factors like inequality and are more supportive of redistribution while rejecting merit-based explanations [@gugushvili_trends_2014]. Taken together, I argue that meritocratic beliefs may reinforce this self-serving attribution mechanism by legitimizing one's social status as the outcome of personal merit, closely tied to attribution bias.

Against this background, this article pursues two main objectives: first, to analyze the extent to which intergenerational social mobility influences market justice preferences regarding healthcare, pensions, and education; and second, to examine how meritocratic beliefs may moderate this relationship. Building on a theoretical framework that emphasizes how neoliberal transformations---particularly through the privatization and commodification of key areas of social reproduction---have profoundly reshaped processes of subject formation [@mau_inequality_2015], the central argument is that upward mobility increases support for market justice preferences, while downward mobility decreases it. Moreover, meritocratic beliefs are expected to moderate this relationship by reflecting a self-serving attribution bias, whereby individuals justify their social position in terms of personal merit.

This study focuses on Chile, a particularly intriguing case for examining market justice preferences. Despite significant economic growth and poverty reduction, Chile has some of the highest levels of inequality in Latin America and among OECD countries [@chancel_world_2022; @flores_top_2020]. This inequality coexists with short-range upward mobility among lower-class segments moving into middle strata, though strong barriers remain to reaching higher positions [@torche_intergenerational_2014; @espinoza_estratificacion_2013]. What makes Chile especially salient is that much of this inequality is rooted in deep neoliberal reforms that institutionalized the privatization and commodification of key social sectors [@madariaga_three_2020]. Introduced during the dictatorship (1973--1989) and expanded in democracy, these reforms enabled the unprecedented emergence of markets in health, pensions, and education, with provision segmented by individuals' ability to pay and supported by public subsidies [@boccardo_30_2020]. In parallel---and despite waves of protest against inequality and commodification from 2006 to 2019 [@somma_no_2021]---Chilean subjectivities have been increasingly shaped by neoliberal discourses and market logics, influencing their attitudes toward inequality and welfare distribution [@araujo_desafios_2012; @canalesceron_sujeto_2021].

In this context, the questions that guide this research are as follows:

(1) To what extent does intergenerational social mobility influence market justice preferences regarding healthcare, pensions, and education in Chile?
(2) How do meritocratic beliefs condition or moderate this relationship in the Chilean context?

To address these questions, this study draws on large-scale, representative survey data collected in 2018 from the urban Chilean population aged 18 to 75 (n = 2,726). The next section outlines the theoretical framework linking market justice preferences, social mobility, and meritocratic beliefs, and proposes a set of hypotheses. This is followed by a description of the data, variables, and analytical strategy. The final sections present the empirical findings, offer an interpretation of the results, and conclude with a discussion of their implications.
